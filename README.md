# 🚗 Sensor Fusion Projects 🚀

Welcome to the **Sensor Fusion Projects** repository! This repository contains two exciting projects focused on **Vehicle Distance Estimation** (Task 1) and **Fusion for Classification** (Task 2). These projects explore the integration of data from multiple sensors (e.g., LiDAR, Radar, and Cameras) to improve object detection, distance estimation, and classification accuracy.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 🚘 **Task 1: Vehicle Distance Estimation**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on estimating the distance of vehicles using sensor fusion techniques. It integrates data from LiDAR, Radar, and Camera sensors to enhance distance estimation accuracy.
   - **Key Features**:
     - 🖼️ Vehicle detection using YOLOv5.
     - 📊 Integration of LiDAR and Radar data for distance estimation.
     - 🔄 Application of a Kalman filter for sensor fusion.
   - **Folder**: [vehicle-distance-estimation](vehicle-distance-estimation)

### 2. 🎯 **Task 2: Fusion for Classification**
   - **Description**: This project explores fusion strategies (Low-Level and High-Level Fusion) to improve the classification accuracy of geometric shapes using a synthetic dataset.
   - **Key Features**:
     - 🧠 Adaptation of the LeNet-5 model for shape classification.
     - 🔧 Implementation of Low-Level and High-Level Fusion techniques.
     - 📈 Comparative analysis of fusion strategies.
   - **Folder**: [fusion-for-classification](fusion-for-classification)
